 news_event.1.d:0 "The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it."

The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne.

Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. Many considered Ferdinand the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them.

 POL_event.2.t:0 "Elective Monarchy in Poland"
 POL_event.2.d:0 "On the death of the last Piast monarch in 1370, Polish nobles began drawing on ancient claims and historical precedent to assert their independence from the monarchy. At first, only a small part of the szlachta, or 'noble class', would assert its privilege to choose the next king (or, in 1384 and 1523 Queen, since they backed Jadwiga's and Anna's claims). But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Poland was extended to Polish nobles. Keep in mind that in Poland, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Poles could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until American and French Republics. True royal elections began in 1573 at the election of Henry of Valois, since foreign princes were always claiming the Polish throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Poland and Grand Princes of Lithuania were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wola, just outside Warsaw. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men. While the election was going on, royal power would be vested in an interrex, a temporary regent - usually the Primate of Warsaw, who would oversee the voting."

 POL_event.3.t:0 "The Polish Inheritance of Mazovia"
 POL_event.3.d:0 "The Duchy of Mazovia had long been ruled by a line of the Piast Dynasty, but because of the power of Poland she most often followed the suggestions of Polish foreign policy. In 1526 the last Piast ruler died and the Polish crown inherited Mazovia. Exactly what would be done with the lands was not clear, but in the end it became a Royal fief. And later the new Polish capital would be placed in the sleepy hamlet of Warszawa."

 POL_event.3488.t:0 "Turko-Polish Tension"
 POL_event.3488.d:0 "Poland and the Ottoman Empire came into conflict in the 1670's and 80's when the Cossacks in the Polish part of the divided Ukraine submitted to the Ottoman Empire and called for Tatar aid against Poland. Victories won by hetman Jan Sobieski only temporarily forestalled the threat, and in 1672 the Commonwealth faced a major invasion by the Ottoman Empire. The fall of the key border fortress Kamieniec Podolski was followed by the humiliating Peace of Buczacz. In 1683 Sobieski led a relief army to Vienna, besieged by the Ottomans, and as supreme commander of the allied forces won a resounding victory that marked the beginning of Ottoman withdrawal from Europe."

 FRA_event.1.d:0 "Charles VII remodeled French finances, established heavy taxation, particularly through the taille, a direct land tax. Extracting the wealth of the land has always been a tough nut to crack for the centralizing French kings. To tap the vast riches of the French lands new and improved taxation methods were needed time after time. Throughout history the methods used became more and more rationalized to optimize gains for the treasury. The Birth of a Permanent Taxation Systems was a major step towards this aim."

 FRA_event.2.d:0 "The word gilde, or ghilde, is but one of many terms used formerly in France and in the Low Countries to denote what the more modern word corporation stands for. In France and the Low Countries a guild was originally a sort of fraternity for common support, protection, and amusement. The members paid each a certain contribution to the common fund. After the end of the fifteenth century, under the despotic rule of the French kings, the guilds ceased to be a means of protection for a majority of their members. Their privileges became a means of filling the royal coffers at the expense of the employers."

French emissaries have repeatedly tried to remind us of this ever since the signing and King Charles VII has now finally taken matters in his own hands and shown up at the walls of Le Mans, demanding the city to surrender.\nUnless we surrender Maine to the French we are very likely looking at a hasty resumption of hostilities."
